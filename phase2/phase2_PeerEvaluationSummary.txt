Send a message in slack before you work on something and also right before you push. This will let everyone know what everyone else is working on.
Wait for at least two other people on slack to approve the changes (react to the message with a tick) before actually pushing, therefore we have accountability and review before we make changes to master.

Delegate work, we should assign tasks more evenly, everyone should know what next to work on.

Check slack more often (daily if possible), make sure notifications are turned on. (Therefore we can all approve changes when necessary)
